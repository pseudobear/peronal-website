# peronal-website
just a personal project

**update**
website is now up at michaelcli.com hosted on digital ocean!

Man. I really spent a whole 30 minutes trying all sorts of things to see why the domain couldn't find the server IP
only to check the DNS records to see that I had spelled my own name wrong on the A record. 

That's gotta be an all time low LOL
